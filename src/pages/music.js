    <p>My love for self-learning began with music--my primary creative outlet before I found coding. I taught myself to DJ when I got involved with the radio station in college, and ended up working part-time as a freelance DJ and at <a href='http://gramaphonerecords.com/'>Gramaphone Records</a> on the weekends. I spent a few months obsessively teaching myself music theory just before I picked up Javascript.</p>
