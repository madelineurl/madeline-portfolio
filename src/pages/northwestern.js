      <div>I moved from California to Chicago for undergrad at Northwestern University. I got my first taste of web development when I overhauled Northwestern's student radio website (wnur.org) as the station's General Manager. This experience got me a job as a Web Assistant for the School of Communication website shortly after graduating, where I learned HTML and CSS on the job and had my first introduction to Javascript.</div>
      <div>I helped modernize the site's frontend, working in Wordpress and writing raw HTML and CSS in Adobe Dreamweaver. I didn't get the chance to learn the backend--which is written in PHP and built with Drupal--while working there, but the seeds of interest were planted.</div>
