      <div>I'm a software engineer and radio host/DJ based in Chicago. I like building applications that create a seamless and accessible user experience. I'm a self driven learner; I spent a few months obsessively teaching myself music theory just before I picked up Javascript. I love to be thorough, and see a project through from concept to completion.</div>
