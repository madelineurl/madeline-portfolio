# PORTFOLIO
Welcome to my portfolio site! I'm Madeline Higgins (aka madelineurl), a fullstack software developer and DJ/producer based in Chicago. I'm a Javascript enthusiast with a background in Cognitive Science - so it follows that I have a special interest in frontend development and UI/UX Design. I build accessible applications that help people connect to their creativity and each other.

## Technologies
This site was built with Javascript React components in Gatsby, styled with raw CSS, and deployed via Netlify.

## Experience
I had my first taste of web dev when I redesigned the Northwestern radio station website while working as the General Manager there (a collaborative effort with then-webmaster Lauren Harris). This sparked a stint as an assistant frontend developer for Northwestern's School of Communication site, where I learned HTML and CSS on the fly while modernizing page layouts and CSS syntax.

I spent the next few years building technical communication skills repairing electronics full-time and DJing professionally on the side. I fell down a Javascript rabbithole one day - and when I came out I quit my job and went through bootcamp at the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. I've since built a variety of fullstack applications, from games and DJ tools to ecommerce sites, trivia apps, and more.

I currently work as a Senior Teaching Fellow (Superfellow) at Fullstack Academy on an extended Teaching Fellow contract. My present work involves managing senior student projects, working on internal tooling tickets, conducting fellowship interviews, and more.
